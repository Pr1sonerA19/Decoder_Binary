# Decoder_Binary
How it works:
Once you download the file, run it in a Lua workspace, I used https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_lua_online.php
Find the "--Config" part, and you can change how long the string generated is.
Run the file, and it will generate the a string of binary.
Once it generates the string of binary, you input your answer.
It will check your answer, and tell you "Incorrect", or "Correct"
